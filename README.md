# BlizzHUDTweaks
A simple add-on which will provide some tweaks to the newly introduced Blizzard HUD (in Dragonflight).

# Usage
Openb the options via the ingame options menu or by typing `/bhudt` or `/blizzhudtweaks`.

# Features
## Mouseover Fade (action bars, frames)
You can fade out most of the actions bars and frames for different scenarios. You can set different alpha values for `In Combat`, `Out of Combat`, and `In Resting Area`. You also can set the options globally and use them for each action bar/frame.

### Configuration options
- Allow mouseover in combat
- Fade Duration
- In Combat Fade
- Out of Combat Fade
- Rested Area Fade

The priority is as follows:
Mouseover > In Combat Fade > Out of Combat Fade > Rested Area Fade.
The Add-ons determines the alpha which should be applied to the corresponding frames based on the settings you applied and the resting/combat state of the player character.

## More will eventually follow

# Performance
Even though the add-on has to check more or less in a set interval, it is very performant. It only uses memory if there are fades being performed and checks in a smart way if there is something to render. If you have any trouble, you can manually set the interval which is used for the fading checks.

# FAQ
## Action bar / frame not showing even though it should
- Please ensure you have enabled the wanted option for the given action bar or frame
- Also, make sure you haven't set the `Bar Visible` option in the Blizzard Edit Mode to something else than `Always visible`
Â  - If set to `Out of Combat` you might be missing the frame or can't mouseover it since the blizzard option overwrites everything else

Initial impressions and ideas came from [Conceal](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/conceal) but i had some things missing and wanted to optimize some stuff.
