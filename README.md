# BlizzHUDTweaks
A simple add-on which will provide some tweaks to the newly introduced Blizzard HUD (in Dragonflight).

## Mouseover Fade
You can fade out most of the actions bars and frames for different scenarios. You can set different alpha values for `In Combat`, `Out of Combat`, and `In Resting Area`. You also can set the options globally and use them for each action bar/frame.

## More will eventually follow
